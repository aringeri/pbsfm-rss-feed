    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Down by the River&lt;/em&gt; is a two-hour journey through the rich and diverse world of folk music. While rooted in tradition, the show blends folk, indie, and acoustic sounds to create a unique listening experience. &lt;em&gt;Down by the River&lt;/em&gt; spotlights artists who may not be considered "classic" folk musicians but have delved into the genre in their work, pushing its boundaries and expanding its scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the deep roots of traditional folk to the evolving sounds of today, this show brings together a wide array of cultural influences, exploring folk music as a dynamic and evolving art form. &lt;em&gt;Down by the River&lt;/em&gt; offers listeners a rich tapestry of sounds that span continents and generations. Across the two hours you’ll hear music that reflects the ever-changing spirit of folk, all the while honoring its timeless art of storytelling through song.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Roger Holdsworth presents Down By The River</title>
      <link>https://www.pbsfm.org.au/program/down-by-the-river/2025-12-25/09-00-00</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Christmas Day – if that is your belief and orientation. &lt;strong&gt;Roger Holdsworth&lt;/strong&gt;, sitting in for &lt;strong&gt;Lauren Plant&lt;/strong&gt;. At this time of the year, I’m split between being &lt;em&gt;‘Ho Ho’&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;‘Bah Humbug’&lt;/em&gt; – but perhaps leaning more towards the latter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you’ll probably hear some music today that inevitably references Christmas Day –not strongly, and certainly not typically, as we wander down by this seasonal river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s actually a program of songs and tunes and stories that I’ve had semi-organised for some time. I look forward to taking you on a wander through folk music from various parts of Australia and the wider world, that include some favourite music.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year – &lt;strong&gt;Roger Holdsworth&lt;/strong&gt;, sitting in for &lt;strong&gt;Lauren Plant&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’ve put together another program of songs and tunes and stories I’ve had organised for some time, so I look forward to taking you on a wander down by the river, through folk music from various parts of Australia and the wider world.  Not too noisy (thankfully), but still fascinating sounds to keep you awake and interested, and into 2026&lt;/p&gt;
