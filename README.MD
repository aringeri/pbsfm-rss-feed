This project provides a set of RSS feeds for listening to [PBS radio](https://www.pbsfm.org.au/) shows with your favourite podcast app (I use [AntennaPod](https://antennapod.org/)).
This allows you to replay, pause, skip previously aired episodes and also download for offline listening.
The RSS feeds are updated daily, and media is sourced from airnet.org.au (https://airnet.org.au/rest/stations/3pbs).

To add a show to your podcast app:
- find the program you want to add in the webpage above
- copy the RSS link (ie `https://aringeri.github.io/pbsfm-rss-feed/feeds/pbsfm/black-wax/rss.xml`)
- paste the link in your app after selecting 'add a podcast by RSS address'.
